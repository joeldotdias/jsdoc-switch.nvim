Introduction                                                 *jsdoc-switch-nvim*

 JSDoc is a solid alternative to typescript when you want to avoid an additional
 build step and write regular javascript. However, you might not want to use this
 this all the time. While your program still runs, the lsp warnings tend to get
 annoying when checking isn't even required. Manually changing the settings in the
 config file is also not a viable option. This was the motivation behind this
 plugin. It lets you turn on or off and toggle the current JSDoc config while
 preserving the rest of your server config.

==============================================================================
Setup                                                       *jsdoc-switch.setup*

 The `setup()` function must be called to create the default keymaps when the plugin
 loads. This can be overridden by passing your custom config which will be merged with
 the default configuration

M.setup({user_config?})                                                *M.setup*
     Sets up the plugin according to provided configuration

    Parameters: ~
        {user_config?}  (JsdocSwitchConfig)

    See: ~
        |jsdoc-switch.config|

    Usage: ~
>lua
         To use the default config, simply call the setup function
         require('jsdoc-switch').setup()

         In case you want to pass custom config, there are two options
         `1. Custom keymaps`
         Send your own choice of keymaps to the setup function
        >
             require('jsdoc-switch').setup({
                 keys = {
                     toggle = '<leader>jsm',
                     checkStart = '<leader>jso',
                     checkEnd = '<leader>jsn'
                 }
             })
        <

         This will override the default keymaps with the ones provided by you. If a keymap
         isnt provided the default keymap for that function will be used

         `2. Custom functions`
         You can use the toggle(), startJsdoc() and stopJsdoc() functions to write your own
         custom functions to further modify any behaviour when the state is toggled. To do
         this, set auto_set_keys to false. Note that in this case all keymaps have to be set
         manually
        >
             local switch = require('jsdoc-switch')
             vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>jsn', function()
                 switch.stopJsdoc()
                 print('Goodbye JSDoc')
             end)
             -- and so on for the other functions
        <
<


M.stopJsdoc()                                                      *M.stopJsdoc*
     This stops JSDoc checking

    Usage: ~
>lua
        require('jsdoc-switch').stopJsdoc()
<


M.startJsdoc()                                                    *M.startJsdoc*
     This starts JSDoc checking

    Usage: ~
>lua
        require('jsdoc-switch').startJsdoc()
<


M.toggle()                                                            *M.toggle*
     This toggles the current state of JSDoc checking

    Usage: ~
>lua
        require('jsdoc-switch').toggle()
<


JsdocKeys                                                            *JsdocKeys*

    Fields: ~
        {toggle?}      (string)
        {checkStart?}  (string)
        {checkEnd?}    (string)


JsdocSwitchConfig                                            *JsdocSwitchConfig*

    Fields: ~
        {keys}  (JsdocKeys)


==============================================================================
Configuration                                              *jsdoc-switch.config*

 Given below is the default config for |jsdoc-switch.setup|. To modify this with
 your custom config, change the options according to your needs and send it to
 the `setup()` function.
>
     {
         keys = {
             toggle = "<leader>jsd",
             checkStart = "<leader>jss",
             checkEnd = "<leader>jse",
         },
         auto_set_keys = true,
     }
<

C.get_default_config()                                    *C.get_default_config*
     Returns the default jsdoc-switch config

    Usage: ~
>lua
        C.get_default_config()
<


C.make_config()                                                  *C.make_config*
     Creates the configuration by merging user_config the default jsdoc-switch config

    See: ~
        |jsdoc-switch.setup|

    Usage: ~
>lua
        require('jsdoc-switch).make_config()
<
